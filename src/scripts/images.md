  Subject: Photos I need from you for the website                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                       
  Hey Julian,     

  I'm adding a photo gallery section to your site. I need 8–12 photos total. Here's exactly what to send:

  ---
  MUST-HAVE shots (these are the most important):

  1. You at the summit — standing at or near the Aconcagua summit cross, ideally with a client or two. Face visible. This is the hero shot of the
  gallery.
  2. You with a client celebrating — on the summit or just below, arms raised, big smiles. Emotion is everything here.
  3. High camp life — tents pitched on the mountain with the landscape behind. Shows the scale of the expedition.
  4. You leading a client on a steep section — rope in hand, technical terrain visible. Shows you working, not just posing.
  5. A client with full gear — crampons, ice axe, layered clothing. Helps prospective clients visualize themselves in it.
  6. A wide landscape shot from altitude — the Andes stretching out below. No people needed, just the view.
  7. Base camp arrival / group moment — the start of the expedition, gear laid out, people looking excited.
  8. A candid mid-route moment — resting, eating, drinking water, chatting. Makes it feel real and human.

  Nice-to-have (send if you have them):

  - A photo with a Chinese-speaking client (important for the Chinese version of the site)
  - Night sky or sunset from high camp
  - You looking at a map or briefing clients
  - Any media coverage moment (camera crew, journalist, etc.)

  Photo requirements & how to prepare them:

  Before sending, please resize and convert each photo using these steps. It takes about 2 minutes per photo on your phone or computer.

  Target specs:
  - Width: exactly 1600px (height adjusts automatically)
  - Format: WebP (not JPG, not PNG — WebP is smaller and loads faster on the web)
  - Quality: 85% when exporting

  (Just use descriptive names so I know what each one is at a glance.)

  What NOT to send:

  - Screenshots of Instagram posts (too low quality to start with)
  - Heavily blurred backgrounds (portrait mode) — the landscape matters
  - Photos where faces are cut off or backs are turned
  - Blurry or shaky shots

  ---
  The goal is to show the full journey — arrival → the climb → the summit → the celebration. Even 8 good photos will make the section look great.
